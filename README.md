# softmaxRegression
This is the algorithm for Softmax Regression where we can classify more than 2 classes. However, training data points are two dimensional
and code is written based on 2 dimensions for easy visualization. A sample dataset is given. To make algorithm work properly, first line 
of file contains number of samples and data dimensions (2 for this case). While training the data, algorithm learns parameters for 
each class using 'One vs Rest' technique. Next, user enters an input to test a point. Finally, algorithm prints out the likelihood (not
exactly the probability) of each class, given the user point.
